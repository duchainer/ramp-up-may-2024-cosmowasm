You are a smart contract developer working on a donation project.
Your platform lets people make donations to any Project,
    a Project is just about anything under which CW20 Tokens are being collected on the contract.
A Project can have a name and creator.
Then any user can come to the contract and donate Tokens under a project.
The contract always Counts
 the donations received under the Project Via a given User
and saves the amount of donation and issues.
This information can be queried with their WALLET ADDRESSES.
The donations are always sent to the PROJECT CREATORS WALLET ADDRESS.
Contract needs to deduct :
 - 10% if the Donation received is less than 10,000 CW 20 TOKENS,
 - 5% if More than that.
Fees collected are sent to the FEE COLLECTOR WALLET.
